					<v-card-title>What is ExpidusOS?</v-card-title>
					<v-card-text>The Expidus operating system is a lightweight Linux distro based on Void Linux. It focuses on use by consumers who don't understand technology well. The system includes built in security with AppArmor to prevent unauthorized applications from causing unintended behaviors. The operating system is designed with a custom interface for the best performance, security, and ease-of-use. ExpidusOS's core is open source on GitHub to allow developers from other companies or freelancers to help with improvements. However, there is a full retail version which includes the application store and integrates support for the ExpidusOS services. These services are the cloud accounts and application marketplace at this time. Though, we plan on launching more services in the future, we are focusing our efforts to make ExpidusOS a stable and usable operating system.</v-card-text>

					<v-card-title>Why use ExpidusOS?</v-card-title>
					<v-card-text>ExpidusOS is designed for those who do not understand technology on a development level. We designed it to be used by seniors, young children, and anyone who wishes for a simple experience. At this time, we do not license the system to people so anyone may install and use both the core and retail versions of ExpidusOS. When designing the operating system, we took a look at websites and applications everybody uses to get an idea of a common design. The system is skinned to have an intuitive modern design. The two themes, Tokyonight and Tokyoday, allows for both dark and light modes in all applications that can be installed.</v-card-text>
